## Importance of public health in life. 
### How can we strength our community?


In the public health chapter of Saahas, we provide opportunites for youth to volunteer in vaccine camps, informational booths, and cultural festivals. In addition to creating a platform for outreach, we also communicate with our team via general weekly meeetings with discussions abotu public health issues, their solutions, and self-care.
